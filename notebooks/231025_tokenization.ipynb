Body: Keel is pretty thin (1.5 out of 5). Wings / Arms: Luxated left elbow. Cannot be in fig-eight without popping back out. Initial exam showed eyes, ears, nose, and mouth are clear, but mouth seems mildly tacky.  Keel is pretty thin (1.5 out of 5).  Luxated left elbow. Cannot be in fig-eight without popping back out. Live checked at 9:15a - very depressed and lethargic. Leaning again the door in the ICU and didn't acknowledge when I opened the door. Immediately got O2 chamber ready for him and texted Heather and Meghan for how they'd like me to handle it. MW felt maybe he's going septic so I administered 0.3cc fresh Ampicillin and 0.13cc Baytril. Did not administer Torb or Metacam per Heather's suggestion. Gave 12cc LRS (so passive I could cradle him in one arm and push in the fluids with the other hand. Dark mouse and hairless mouse were left over in the enclosure. No cast. Several mutes in the enclosures - all were bright green and some were quite watery (perhaps that is from an attempted cast?). Continued to check several times throughout the morning. As of 11:15a there is no change in LOC and breathing still seems quite labored. 12:15 PM - Live checked - Mantling when I checked on him - half standing (some on his feet and some on his hocks) and more active than when last checked. 2:30 PM - Much more alert upon initial encounter, but quickly faded as I was giving 0.3cc Ampicillin and 12cc LRS. Was able to prop him up on a towel in O2 and give the fluids without even restraining his legs... He is acting like he is gasping for breath. Another fecal in the chamber - very small and very green. Put him back in the modified donut for support (he had gotten himself out). 3:00 PM - Took a quick chest x-ray and sent it to heather and Meghan as well as a photo of the deep purple vein in the back of his mouth. He is again very lethargic and \"sleepy\", but he has more energy after sitting in the O2. I bumped the O2 to 45% in case he is indeed struggling to get enough air. 5:00 PM - Seems a bit more with it again. Lisa and BC gave 12cc LRS as quickly as possible out of the o2 chamber. He faded quickly. Skin appears to have a lot of bruising all over... noticed on left leg as well. Still straining to breath. 7p: CA in to give him 0.3cc Amp IM. Very strained breathing. Kept time out of 02 to a minimum\n",

      "261 resident found in middle of street; resident put into box. Feathers / Fur / Skin: In molt; no broken feather patches found; waterproofing and buoyancy NOT tested Body: Possible crepitus in L coracoid towards keel? Legs / Feet / Hocks: RD3 - abrasion on distal and medial joint on plantar surface. [Flushed with nolvasan and covered with tegaderm]. Temp normal on intake, bird is BAR and feisty for handling.  Bird was found in middle of road on pavement [area found is just south of San Joaquin River], both L and R feet have moderate soft-tissue damage on all digits, worst wounds are on L middle digit where \"nail\" of digit appears to have been torn/abraded off of digit entirely On R foot middle digit, one lesion appears somewhat deep with possible bone/tendon exposure... Rx-ing Baytril and Clind given extent and location of foot wounds, low dose SID meloxicam, tube.  Cleaned feet and wounds with dilute chlorhex; .  We don't have any hydrogel or similar, also we don't have \"normal\" tegaderm so I'm improvising a bit- want to get wounds covered to prevent further abrasion and get feet covered to avoid further friction.  Applied small amount of water-based lubricant to both feet and covered with \"booties\" made out of some weird/thick Tegaderm derivative.  Added stockinette over feet and fastened below hocks using vetwrap, and joined ends of booties with tape.  Wings, legs, spine all palpate WNL- possible crepitus felt in L coracoid but difficult to reproduce.  Plan to tube bird fluids, get meds on board and get to IBR ASAP. (Mariah MH)\n",

      "270 mange. mange, large skin tear near L pelvis. Eyes / Ears / Mouth / Nares: Eyes looks pretty good, R eye has maybe a little crust in it, MM pink and moist, teeth intact and aligned Neurologic: BAR, feisty, painful Musculoskeletal: reasonable Feathers / Fur / Skin: mange crusts all along neck, belly, arms and legs Wings / Arms: moving well Legs / Feet / Hocks: moving well, a significant skin tear in L pelvic area (pics attached). Patient has large mange crusts along belly, neck, arms and legs. Face seems not badly affected. Patient has a significant skin tear in the L pelvic area from the mange crusts cracking - unsure if this happened when patient was picked up on intake or if it was already cracked open when he arrived. Due to all the surrounding skin being heavily crusted with mange, suturing the tear is not an option. Packed it heavily with Intrasite in hopes that this will be enough to keep he wound moist and protected for a few days so patient will not need t o be picked up again. Each instance of handling will risk further tearing. Will have to be very hands-off with this patient as it heals and will monitor the wound, cleaning and applying more gel as needed. His attitude and hydration are good, so hoping a hands-off approach will allow him to heal and recover. Will still give all his meds orally but just by inserting syringe into mouth while he's in his unit, not picking him up. And will avoid moving him to a new unit for a few days\n",

Neurologic: Depressed mentation, minimally responsive to tactile stimulation, normal motor function in all four flippers. Heart / Lungs: Normal rate and rhythm, normal BV sounds OU. GI / Vent: Soft abdominal palpation. S: Male weaned elephant seal pup was rescued from Long Beach in Pacific county the evening of 2 June. Pup was assessed by PSU, SR3 rescued and transported patient to rehab. Upon arrival, pup was depressed and markedly dehydrated. \n",
